   - added bioperl-source-mode for source viewing
     'i' mapped to imenu in bioperl-source-mode
     'q' now quits and closes source viewer
   - when running 'bioperl-view-pod' (RETURN key) in pod
     view mode, the default completion namespace is the 
     namespace of the module that is currently being 
     viewed (rather than plain 'Bio::')

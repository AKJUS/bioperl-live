   Abstract

   This is a HOWTO written in DocBook (XML) that talks about using
   [4]Bioperl, for biologists who would like to learn more about writing
   their own bioinformatics scripts using [5]Bioperl.

   What is [6]Bioperl? It is an open source bioinformatics toolkit used
   by researchers all over the world. If you're looking for a script
   built to fit your exact need it's likely you won't find it in
   [7]Bioperl. What you will find is a diverse set of Perl modules that
   will enable you to write your own script, and a commmunity of people
   who are willing to help you.

1. Introduction

   If you're a molecular biologist it's likely that you're interested in
   gene and protein sequences, and you study them in some way on a
   regular basis. Perhaps you'd like to try your hand at automating some
   of these tasks, or you're just curious about learning more about the
   programming side of bioinformatics. In this HOWTO you'll see
   discussions of some of the common uses of [24]Bioperl, like sequence
   analysis with BLAST and retrieving sequences from public databases.
   You'll also see how to write [25]Bioperl scripts that chain these
   tasks together, that's how you'll be able to do really powerful things
   with [26]Bioperl.

   You will also see some discussions of software concepts, this can't be
   avoided. The more you understand about programming the better, but all
   efforts will be made to not introduce too much unfamiliar material.
   However, there will be an introducton to modularity, or objects. This
   is one of the aspects of the [27]Bioperl package that you'll have to
   come to grips with as you attempt more complex tasks with your
   scripts.

   One of the challenging aspects of learning a new skill is learning the
   jargon, and programming certainly has its share of interesting terms
   and concepts. Be patient - remember that the programmers learning
   biology have had just as tough a task (if not worse - just ask them!).
   [Note]
   Note

   This HOWTO does not discuss a very nice module that's designed for
   beginners, [28]Bio::Perl. The reason is that though this is an
   excellent introductory tool, it is not object-oriented and can't be
   extended. What we're attempting here is to introduce [29]Bioperl and
   show you ways to expand your new-found skills.

2. Installing [30]Bioperl

   The first thing to determine is the [31]Bioperl platform - Unix or
   Windows? Here are some things to consider, if you're choosing between
   the two.

   Unix Advantages

   Knowing some Unix is a useful skill. No matter how prevalent Windows
   is on the desktop, Unix rules bioinformatics.
   Unix isn't as hard as you may think, if you know less than 10 commands
   you're ready to work.
   Every bioinformatics application you've ever heard of runs on Unix.
   If you want to do serious computation the typical Unix server is
   probably more stable and more powerful than the available Windows
   machine.
   There may be an administrator taking care of the machine - maybe
   she'll even install [32]Bioperl for you! Ask and see.

   Unix Disadvantages

   The command-line can seem unfamiliar and awkward at first.
   Your Unix account may be on a server - not too portable!
   You may not have easy access to all your familiar programs.
   You'll probably have to learn to use a Unix word processor, like emacs
   or vi.
   You may not have control of the machine, the administrator will. You
   may not be able to download all of Genbank, for example!

   Windows Advantages

   Simplicity, if Windows is what you're working with now.
   Plenty of [33]Bioperl users run it on Windows.

   Windows Disadvantages

   Not all bioinformatics applications run on Windows.
   It's your computer, you will have to deal with the installation
   details yourself.
   Your computer may not be able to handle serious computation
   gracefully.
   [Tip]
   Tip

   If you decide to use Unix there are many Web pages that can give you a
   good introduction, google "introduction unix" to see more than a few.

   You should also read the instructions for [34]Unix installation or
   [35]Windows installation. Many of the letters to the the bioperl-l
   mailing list concern problems with installation, and there is a set of
   concerns that come up repeatedly:

    1. On Windows, messages like "Error: Failed to download URL
       http://bioperl.org/DIST/GD.ppd", or "Not found". The explanation
       is that [36]Bioperl does not supply every accessory module that's
       necessary to run all of [37]Bioperl. You'll need to search other
       repositories to install all of these accessory modules. See the
       [38]INSTALL.WIN file for more information.
    2. On Unix, messages like "Can't locate <some-module>.pm in @INC...".
       This means that Perl could not find a particular module and the
       explanation usually is that this module is not installed. You can
       either install Bundle::[39]Bioperl or install that specific module
       by hand. See [40]INSTALL for details.
    3. Seeing messages like "Tests Failed". If you see an error during
       installation consider whether this problem is going to affect your
       use of [41]Bioperl. There are almost 800 modules in [42]Bioperl,
       and ten times that many tests are run during the installation. If
       there's a complaint about GD it's only relevant if you want to use
       the Bio/Graphics modules, if you see an error about some XML
       parser it's only going to affect you if you're reading XML files.
       Yes, you could try and make each and every test pass, but that may
       be a lot of work, with much of it fixing modules that aren't in
       [43]Bioperl itself.

3. Getting Assistance

   People will run into problems installing [44]Bioperl or writing
   scripts using [45]Bioperl, nothing unusual about that. If you need
   assistance the way to get it is to mail bioperl-l@bioperl.org. There
   are a good number of helpful people who regularly read this list but
   if you want their advice it's best to give sufficent detail.

   Please include:

    1. The version of [46]Bioperl you're working with.
    2. The platform or operating system you're using.
    3. What you are trying to do.
    4. The code that gives the error, if you're writing a script.
    5. Any error messages you saw.

   Every once in a while a message will appear in bioperl-l coming from
   someone in distress that goes unanswered. The explanation is usually
   that the person neglected to include 1 or more of the details above,
   usually the script or the error messages.
   [Note]
   Note

   And every once in a while, not often, an email will go unanswered
   because the the tone is unpleasant. [47]Bioperl is a 100% volunteer
   effort, we all have other jobs, complaining about bugs or lack of
   documentation is not the way to make friends!

4. Perl Itself

   Here are a few things you might want to look at if you want to learn
   more about Perl:

   Perl's own documentation. Do "perldoc perl" from the command-line for
   an introduction.
   [48]Learning Perl is the most frequently cited beginner's book.
   [49]Perl in a Nutshell is also good. Not much in the way of examples,
   but covers many topics succintly.

5. Starting to write a script on Unix

   Sometimes the trickiest part is this step, writing something and
   getting it to run, so this section attempts to address some of the
   more common tribulations.

   In Unix when you're ready to work you're usually in the command-line
   or "shell" environment. First find out Perl's version by typing this
   command:

>perl -v

   You will see something like:

This is perl, v5.8.2 built for cygwin-thread-multi-64int

Copyright 1987-2003, Larry Wall

GNU General Public License, which may be found in the Perl 5 source kit.

Complete documentation for Perl, including FAQ lists, should be found on
this system using `man perl' or `perldoc perl'.  If you have access to the
Internet, point your browser at http://www.perl.com/, the Perl Home Page.

   Hopefully you're using Perl version 5.4 or higher, earlier versions
   may be troublesome. Now let's find out where the Perl program is
   located:

>which perl

   This will give you something like:

>/bin/perl

   Now that we know where Perl is located we're ready to write a script,
   and line 1 of the script will specify this location. You're probably
   using some Unix word processor, emacs or vi, for example (nano or pico
   are other possible choices, very easy to use, but not found on all
   Unix machines unfortunately). Start to write your script by entering
   something like:

>emacs seqio.pl

   And make this the first line of the script:

#!/bin/perl -w

   The -w flag tells Perl to warn you if and when various common errors
   are encountered, it's useful.

6. Creating a sequence, and an object

   Our first script will create a sequence. Well, not just a sequence,
   you will be creating a "sequence object", since [50]Bioperl is written
   in an object-oriented way. Why be object-oriented? Why introduce these
   odd or intrusive notions into software that should be "biological" or
   "intuitive"? The reason is that thinking in terms of modules or
   objects turns out to be the most flexible, and ultimately the
   simplest, way to deal with data as complex as biological data. Once
   you get over your initial skepticism, and have written a few scripts,
   you will find this idea of an object becoming a bit more natural.

   One way to think about an object in software is that it is a container
   for data. The typical sequence entry contains differents sorts of data
   (a sequence, one or more identifiers, and so on) so it will serve as a
   nice example of what an object can be.

   All objects in [51]Bioperl are created by specific [52]Bioperl
   modules, so if you want to create an object you're also going to have
   to tell Perl which module to use. Let's add another line:

#!/bin/perl -w

use Bio::Seq;

   This line tells Perl to use a module on your machine called
   "Bio/Seq.pm". We will use this [53]Bio::Seq module to create a
   [54]Bio::Seq object. The [55]Bio::Seq module is one of the central
   modules in [56]Bioperl. The analogous [57]Bio::Seq object, or
   "Sequence object", or "Seq object", is ubiquitous in [58]Bioperl, it
   contains a single sequence and associated names, identifiers, and
   properties. Let's create a very simple sequence object at first, like
   so:

#!/bin/perl -w

use Bio::Seq;

$seq_obj = Bio::Seq->new(-seq => "aaaatgggggggggggccccgtt"
                         -alphabet => 'dna' );

   That's it! The variable $seq_obj is the Sequence object, a simple one,
   containing just a sequence. Note that the code tells [59]Bioperl that
   the sequence is DNA (the choices here are 'dna', 'rna', and
   'protein'), this is the wise thing to do. If you don't tell
   [60]Bioperl it will attempt to guess the alphabet. Normally it guesses
   correctly but if your sequence has lots of odd or ambiguous
   characters, such as N or X, [61]Bioperl's guess may be incorrect and
   this may lead to some problems.

   [62]Bio::Seq objects can be created manually, as above, but they're
   also create automatically in many operations in [63]Bioperl, for
   example when alignment files or database entries or BLAST reports are
   parsed.

   Any time you explicitly create an object, you will use this new()
   method. The syntax of this line is one you'll see again and again in
   [64]Bioperl: the name of the object or variable, the module name, the
   -> symbol, the method name new, some argument name like -seq, the =>
   symbol, and then the argument or value itself, like
   aaaatgggggggggggccccgtt.
   [Note]
   Note

   If you've programmed before you've come across the term "function" or
   "sub-routine". In object-oriented programming the term "method" is
   used instead.

   The object was described as a data container, but it is more than
   that. It can also do work, meaning it can use or call specific methods
   taken from the module or modules that were used to create it. For
   example, the [65]Bio::Seq module can access a method named seq() that
   will print out the sequence of [66]Bio::Seq objects. You could use it
   like this:

#!/bin/perl -w

use Bio::Seq;

$seq_obj = Bio::Seq->new(-seq => "aaaatgggggggggggccccgtt",
                         -alphabet => 'dna' );

print $seq_obj->seq;

   As you'd expect, this script will print out aaaatgggggggggggccccgtt.
   That -> symbol is used when an object calls or accesses its methods.

   Let's make our example a bit more true-to-life, since a typical
   sequence needs an identifier, perhaps a description, in addition to
   its sequence.

#!/bin/perl -w

use Bio::Seq;

$seq_obj = Bio::Seq->new(-seq => "aaaatgggggggggggccccgtt",
                         -display_id => "#12345",
                         -desc => "example 1",
                         -alphabet => "dna" );

print $seq_obj->seq();

   aaaatgggggggggggccccgtt, #12345, and example 1 are called "arguments"
   in programming jargon. You could say that this example shows how to
   pass arguments to the new method.

7. Writing a sequence to a file

   This next example will show how two objects can work together to
   create a sequence file. We already have a Sequence object, $seq_obj,
   and we will create an additional object whose responsibility it is to
   read from and write to files. This object is the SeqIO object, where
   IO stands for Input-Output. By using [67]Bio::SeqIO in this manner you
   will be able to get input and make output for all of the sequence file
   formats supported by [68]Bioperl (the [69]SeqIO HOWTO has a complete
   list of supported formats). The way you create Bio::SeqIO objects is
   very similar to the way we used new() to create a [70]Bio::Seq, or
   sequence, object:

use Bio::SeqIO;

$seqio_obj = Bio::SeqIO->new(-file => '>sequence.fasta',
                             -format => 'fasta' );

   Note that > in the -file argument. This character indicates that we're
   going to write to the file named "sequence.fasta", the same character
   we'd use if we were using Perl's open() function to write to a file.
   The "-format" argument, "fasta", tells the SeqIO object that it should
   create the file in fasta format.

   Let's put our 2 examples together:

#!/bin/perl -w

use Bio::Seq;
use Bio::SeqIO;

$seq_obj = Bio::Seq->new(-seq => "aaaatgggggggggggccccgtt",
                         -display_id => "#12345",
                         -desc => "example 1",
                         -alphabet => "dna" );

$seqio_obj = Bio::SeqIO->new(-file => '>sequence.fasta',
                             -format => 'fasta' );

$seqio_obj->write_seq($seq_obj);

   Let's consider that last write_seq line where you see two objects
   since this is where some neophytes start to get a bit nervous. What's
   going on there? In that line we handed or passed the Sequence object
   to the SeqIO object as an argument to its write_seq method. Another
   way to think about this is that we hand the Sequence object to the
   SeqIO object since SeqIO understands how to take information from the
   Sequence object and write to a file using that information, in this
   case in fasta format. If you run this script like this:

>perl seqio.pl

   You should create a file called "sequence.fasta" that looks like this:

>#12345 example 1
aaaatgggggggggggccccgtt

   Let's demonstrate the intelligence of the SeqIO - the example below
   shows what file content is created when the argument to "-format" is
   set to "genbank" instead of "fasta":

LOCUS       #12345                    23 bp    dna     linear   UNK
DEFINITION  example 1
ACCESSION   unknown
FEATURES             Location/Qualifiers
BASE COUNT        4 a      4 c     12 g      3 t
ORIGIN
        1 aaaatggggg ggggggcccc gtt
//

8. Retrieving a sequence from a file

   One beginner's mistake is to not use [71]Bio::SeqIO when working with
   sequence files. This is understandable in some respects. You may have
   read about Perl's open function, and [72]Bioperl's way of retrieving
   sequences may look odd and overly complicated, at first. But don't use
   open! Using open immediately forces you to do the parsing of the
   sequence file and this can get complicated very quickly. Trust the
   SeqIO object, it's built to open and parse all the common sequence
   formats, it can read and write to files, and it's built to operate
   with all the other [73]Bioperl modules that you will want to use.

   Let's read the file we created previously, "sequence.fasta", using
   SeqIO. The syntax will look familiar:

#!/bin/perl -w

use Bio::SeqIO;

$seqio_obj = Bio::SeqIO->new(-file => "sequence.fasta",
                             -format => "fasta" );

   One difference is immediately apparent: there is no > character. Just
   as with with the open() function this means we'll be reading from the
   "sequence.fasta" file. Let's add the key line, where we actually
   retrieve the Sequence object from the file using the next_seq method:

#!/bin/perl -w

use Bio::SeqIO;

$seqio_obj = Bio::SeqIO->new(-file => "sequence.fasta",
                             -format => "fasta" );

$seq_obj = $seqio_obj->next_seq;

   Here we've used the next_seq() method of the [74]Bio::SeqIO object.
   When you use, or call, next_seq() the SeqIO object will get the next
   available sequence, in this case the first sequence in the file that
   was just opened. The Sequence object, $seq_obj, that's created will be
   identical to to the Sequence object we created manually in our first
   example. This is another idiom that's used frequently in [75]Bioperl,
   the next_<something> method. You'll come across the same idea in the
   next_aln method of [76]AlignIO (reading and writing alignment files)
   and the next_hit method of [77]SearchIO (reading the output of
   sequence comparison programs such as BLAST and HMMER).

   If there were multiple sequences in the input file you could just
   continue to call next_seq() in some loop, and SeqIO would retrieve the
   Seq objects, one by one, until none were left:

while ($seq_obj = $seqio_obj->next_seq){
    # print the sequence
    print $seq_obj->seq,"\n";
}

   Do you have to supply a "-format" argument when you are reading from a
   file, as we did? Not necessarily, but it's the safe thing to do. If
   you don't give a format then the SeqIO object will try to determine
   the format from the file suffix or extension (and a list of the file
   extensions is in the [78]SeqIO HOWTO). In fact, the suffix "fasta" is
   one that SeqIO understands, so "-format" is unnecessary above. Without
   a known suffix SeqIO will attempt to guess the format based on the
   file's contents but there's no guarantee that it can guess correctly
   for every single format.
   [Tip]
   Tip

   It may be useful to tell SeqIO the alphabet of the input, using the
   "-alphabet" argument. What this does is to tell SeqIO not to try to
   determine the alphabet ("dna", "rna", "protein"). This helps because
   [79]Bioperl may guess incorrectly (e.g. [80]Bioperl is going to guess
   that the protein sequence "MGGGGTCAATT" is DNA) or there may be odd
   characters in the sequence that SeqIO objects to (e.g. "-"). Set
   "-alphabet" to a value when reading sequences and SeqIO will not
   attempt to guess the alphabet of those sequences or validate the
   sequences.

9. Retrieving a sequence from a database

   One of the strengths of [81]Bioperl is that it allows you to retrieve
   sequences from all sorts of sources, files, remote databases, local
   databases, regardless of their format. Let's use this capability to
   get a entry from Genbank. What will we retrieve? Again, a Sequence
   object. Let's choose our module:

use Bio::DB::GenBank;

   We could also query [82]SwissProt, GenPept, EMBL, [83]SeqHound, or
   RefSeq in an analogous fashion (e.g "use Bio::DB::SwissProt"). Now
   we'll create the object:

use Bio::DB::GenBank;

$db_obj = Bio::DB::GenBank->new;

   In this case we've created a "database object" using the new method,
   but without any arguments. Let's ask the object to do something
   useful:

use Bio::DB::GenBank;

$db_obj = Bio::DB::GenBank->new;

$seq_obj = $db_obj->get_Seq_by_id(2);

   The argument passed to the get_Seq_by_id method is an identifier, 2, a
   Genbank GI number. You could also use the get_Seq_by_acc method, this
   would accept an accession number, "A12345" for example. Make sure to
   use the proper identifier for the method you use, the methods are not
   interchangeable.

   There are more sophisticated ways to query Genbank than this. This
   next example attempts to do something "biological", using the module
   [84]Bio::DB::Query::GenBank. Want all Arabidopsis topoisomerases from
   Genbank Nucleotide? This would be a reasonable first attempt:

use Bio::DB::Query::GenBank;

$query = "Arabidopsis[ORGN] AND topoisomerase[TITL] and 0:3000[SLEN]";
$query_obj = Bio::DB::Query::GenBank->new(-db    => 'nucleotide',
                                          -query => $query );

   [Note]
   Note

   This capability to query by string and field is only available for
   GenBank as of [85]Bioperl version 1.5, queries to other databases,
   like [86]Swissprot or EMBL, are limited to identifiers and accessions.
   You can find detailed information on Genbank's query fields [87]here.

   That is how we would construct a query object, but we haven't
   retrieved sequences yet. To do so we will have to create a database
   object, some object that can get Sequence objects for us, just as we
   did in the first Genbank example:

use Bio::DB::GenBank;
use Bio::DB::Query::GenBank;

$query = "Arabidopsis[ORGN] AND topoisomerase[TITL] and 0:3000[SLEN]";
$query_obj = Bio::DB::Query::GenBank->new(-db    => 'nucleotide',
                                          -query => $query );

$gb_obj = Bio::DB::GenBank->new;

$stream_obj = $gb_obj->get_Stream_by_query($query_obj);

while ($seq_obj = $stream_obj->next_seq) {
     # do something with the sequence object
     print $seq_obj->display_id, "\t", $seq_obj->length, "\n";
}

   That $stream_obj and its get_Stream_by_query method may not look
   familiar. The idea is that you will use a stream whenever you expect
   to retrieve a stream or series of sequence objects. Much like
   get_Seq_by_id, but built to retrieve one or more objects, not just one
   object.

   Notice how carefully separated the responsibilities of each object are
   in the code above: there's an object just to hold the query, an object
   to execute the query using this query object, an object to do the I/O,
   and finally the sequence object.

   [Warning]
   Warning

   Be careful what you ask for, many of today's nucleotide database
   entries are genome-size and you will probably run out of memory if
   your query happens to match one of these monstrosities. You can use
   the SLEN field to limit the size of the sequences you retrieve.

10. The Sequence object

   There's been a lot of discussion around the Sequence object, and this
   object has been created in a few different ways, but we haven't shown
   what it's capable of doing. The table below lists the methods
   available to you if you have a Sequence object in hand. "Returns"
   means what the object will give you when you ask it for data. Some
   methods, such as seq(), can be used to get or set values. You're
   setting when you assign a value, you're getting when you ask the
   object what values it has. For example, to get or retrieve a value

$sequence = $seq_obj->seq;


   To set or assign a value:

$seq_obj->seq("MMTYDFFFFVVNNNNPPPPAAAW");


   Name Returns Example Note
   new Sequence object $so = Bio::Seq->new(-seq => "MPQRAS") create a new
   one
   seq sequence string $seq = $so->seq get or set the sequence

   Table 1. Sequence Object Methods

   The table above shows the methods you're likely to use that concern
   the Sequence object directly. There are also a number of methods that
   are concerned with the Features and Annotations associated with the
   Sequence object. This is something of a tangent but if you'd like to
   learn about Features and Annotations see the relevant [90]HOWTO. The
   methods related to this topic are shown below.

   Name Returns Note
   get_SeqFeatures array of SeqFeature objects
   get_all_SeqFeatures array of SeqFeature objects array includes
   sub-features

11. Example Sequence objects

   Let's use some of the methods above and see what they return when the
   sequence object is obtained from different sources. In the Genbank
   example we're assuming we've used Genbank to retrieve or create a
   Sequence object. So this object could have have been retrieved like
   this:

use Bio::DB::GenBank;

$db_obj = Bio::DB::GenBank->new;
$seq_obj = $db_obj->get_Seq_by_acc("J01673");

   Or it could have been created from a file like this:

use Bio::SeqIO;

$seqio_obj = Bio::SeqIO->new(-file => "J01673.gb",
                             -format => "genbank" );
$seq_obj = $seqio_obj->next_seq;

   What the Genbank file looks like:

   Table 3. Values from the Sequence object (Genbank)

   There's a few comments that need to be made. First, you noticed that
   there's an awful lot of information missing. All of this missing
   information is stored in what [91]Bioperl calls Features and
   Annotations, see the [92]Feature and Annotation HOWTO if you'd like to
   learn more about this. Second, a few of the methods don't return
   anything, like namespace and authority. The reason is that though
   these are good values in principle there are no commonly agreed upon
   standard names - perhaps someday the authors will be able to rewrite
   the code when all our public databases agree what these values should
   be. Finally, you may be wondering why the method names are what they
   are and why particular fields or identifiers end up associated with
   particular methods. Again, without having standard names for things
   that are agreed upon by the creators of our public databases all the
   authors could do is use common sense, and these choices seem to be
   reasonable ones.

   Next let's take a look at the values returned by the methods used by
   the Sequence object when a fasta file is used as input. The fasta file
   entry looks like this, clearly much simpler than the corresponding
   Genbank entry:

>gi|147605|gb|J01673.1|ECORHO E.coli rho gene coding for transcription terminat
i

AACCCTAGCACTGCGCCGAAATATGGCATCCGTGGTATCCCGACTCTGCTGCTGTTCAAAAACGGTGAAG

ACGTGTTTACGTGGCGTTTTGCTTTTATATCTGTAATCTTAATGCCGCGCTGGGCATGTTAGGAAAATTC
CTGGAATTTGCTGGCATGTTATGCAATTTGCATATCAAATGGTTAATTTTTGCACAGGAC

   And here are the values:

      Method                              Returns
   display_id   gi|147605|gb|J01673.1|ECORHO
   desc         E.coli rho gene coding for transcription termination factor
   display_name gi|147605|gb|J01673.1|ECORHO
   accession    unknown
   primary_id   gi|147605|gb|J01673.1|ECORHO
   is_circular 
   namespace   
   authority   
   length       1880
   seq          AACCCT...ACAGGAC

   Table 4. Values from the Sequence object (FASTA)

   If you compare these values to the values taken from the Genbank entry
   you'll see that certain values are missing, like seq_version. That's
   because values like these aren't usually present in a fasta file.

   Another natural question is why the values returned by methods like
   display_id are different even though the only thing distinguishing
   these entries are their respective formats. The reason is that there
   are no rules governing how one interconverts formats, meaning how
   Genbank creates fasta files from Genbank files may be different from
   how [93]SwissProt performs the same interconversion. Until the
   organizations creating these databases agree on standard sets of names
   and formats all the [94]Bioperl authors can do is do make reasonable
   choices.
   [Note]
   Note

   Yes, [95]Bioperl could follow the conventions of a single organization
   like Genbank such that display_id returns the same value when using
   Genbank format or Genbank's fasta format but the authors have elected
   not to base Bioperl around the conventions of any one organization.

   Let's use a [96]Swissprot file as our last example. The input entry
   looks like this:

   [98]Feature and Annotation HOWTO for more.

12. BLAST

   You have access to a large number of sequence analysis programs within
   [99]Bioperl. Typically this means you have a means to run the program
   and frequently a means of parsing the resulting output, or report, as
   well. Certainly the most popular analytical program is BLAST so let's
   use it as an example. First you'll need to get BLAST, also known as
   blastall, installed on your machine and running and versions of the
   program that can run on all the popular operating systems can be
   downloaded from [100]NCBI. The example code assumes that you used the
   formatdb program to index the database sequence file "db.fa".

   As usual, we start by choosing a module to use, in this case
   [101]Bio::Tools::Run::StandAloneBlast. You stipulate the parameters
   used by the blastall program by populating an array, it's called
   @params in this example but any name for the array will work:

use Bio::Tools::Run::StandAloneBlast;

@params = (program  => 'blastn',
           database => 'db.fa' );


   As you'd expect, we want to create a Blast object, and we will pass a
   Sequence object to the Blast object, this Sequence object will be used
   as the query:

use Bio::Seq;
use Bio::Tools::Run::StandAloneBlast;

@params = (program  => 'blastn',
           database => 'db.fa' );

$blast_obj = Bio::Tools::Run::StandAloneBlast->new(@params);

$seq_obj = Bio::Seq->new(-id  =>"test query",
                         -seq =>"TTTAAATATATTTTGAAGTATAGATTATATGTT");

$report_obj = $blast_obj->blastall($seq_obj);

$result_obj = $report_obj->next_result;

print $result_obj->num_hits;

   By calling the blastall method you're actually running BLAST, creating
   the report file, and parsing the report file's contents. All the data
   in the report ends up in the report object, and you can access or
   print out the data in all sorts of ways. The report object,
   $report_obj, and the result object, $result_obj, come from the
   SearchIO modules. The [102]SearchIO HOWTO will tell you all about
   using these objects to extract useful data from your BLAST analyses.

   Here's an example of how one would use SearchIO to extract data from a
   BLAST report:

    use Bio::SearchIO;

    $report_obj = new Bio::SearchIO(-format => 'blast',
                                    -file   => 'report.bls');
    while( $result = $report_obj->next_result ) {
      while( $hit = $result->next_hit ) {
        while( $hsp = $hit->next_hsp ) {
            if ( $hsp->percent_identity > 75 ) {
              print "Hit\t",        $hit->name,             "\n",
                    "Length\t",     $hsp->length('total'),  "\n",
                    "Percent_id\t", $hsp->percent_identity, "\n";
          }
        }
      }
    }

   This code prints out details about the match when the HSP or aligned
   pair are greater than 75% identical.

   Sometimes you'll see errors when you try to use
   [103]Bio::Tools::Run::StandAloneBlast that have nothing to do with
   [104]Bioperl. Make sure that BLAST is set up properly and running
   before you attempt to script it using
   [105]Bio::Tools::Run::StandAloneBlast. There are some notes on setting
   up BLAST in the [106]INSTALL file.

   [107]Bioperl enables you to run a wide variety of bioinformatics
   programs but in order to do so, in most cases, you will need to
   install the accessory bioperl-run package. In addition there is no
   guarantee that there is a corresponding parser for the program that
   you wish to run, but parsers have been built for the most popular
   programs. You can find the bioperl-run package on the [108]download
   page.

13. Indexing for Fast Retrieval

   One of the under-appreciated features of [109]Bioperl is its ability
   to index sequence files. The idea is that you would create some
   sequence file locally and create an index file for it that enables you
   to retrieve sequences from the sequence file. Why would you want to do
   this? Speed, for one. Retrieving sequences from local, indexed
   sequence files is much faster than using the Bio::DB* modules that
   were used above. It's also much faster than using SeqIO, in part
   because SeqIO is stepping through the file, one sequence at a time,
   starting at the beginning of the file. Flexibility is another reason.
   What if you'd created your own collection of sequences, not found in a
   public database? By indexing this collection you'll get fast access to
   your sequences.

   There's only one requirement here, the term or id that you use to
   retrieve the sequence object must be unique in the index, these
   indices are not built to retrieve multiple sequence objects at a time.

   Let's begin our script with the use statement and also set up our
   environment with some variables (the sequence file, fasta format, will
   be called "sequence.fa"):

use Bio::Index::Fasta;
$ENV{BIOPERL_INDEX_TYPE} = "SDBM_File";
$ENV{BIOPERL_INDEX} = ".";

   The lines above show that you can set environmental variables from
   within Perl and they are stored in Perl's own %ENV hash. This is
   essentially the same thing as the following in tcsh or csh:

>setenv BIOPERL_INDEX_TYPE SDBM_File

   Or the following in the bash shell:

>export BIOPERL_INDEX_TYPE=SDBM_File

   The BIOPERL_INDEX_TYPE variable refers to the indexing scheme, and
   SDBM_File is the scheme that comes with Perl. BIOPERL_INDEX stipulates
   the location of the index file, and this way you could have more than
   one index file per sequence file if you wanted, by designating
   multiple locations (and the utility of more than 1 index will become
   apparent).

   Now let's construct the index:

$ENV{BIOPERL_INDEX_TYPE} = "SDBM_File";
$ENV{BIOPERL_INDEX} = ".";
use Bio::Index::Fasta;

$file_name = "sequence.fa";
$id = "48882";
$inx = Bio::Index::Fasta->new (-filename => $file_name . ".idx",
                               -write_flag => 1);
$inx->make_index($file_name);

   You would execute this script in the directory containing the
   "sequence.fa" file, and it would create an index file called
   "sequence.fa.idx". Then you would retrieve a sequence object like
   this:

$seq_obj = $inx->fetch($id)

   By default the fasta indexing code will use the string following the >
   character as a key, meaning that fasta header line should look
   something like this if you want to fetch using the value "48882":

>48882 pdb|1CRA

   However, what if you wanted to retrieve using some other key, like
   "1CRA" in the example above? You can customize the index by using
   [110]Bio::Index::Fasta's id_parser method, which accepts the name of a
   function as an argument where that function tells the indexing object
   what key to use. For example:

$inx->id_parser(\&get_id);
$inx->make_index($file_name);

sub get_id {
        $header = shift;
        $header =~ /pdb\|(\S+)/;
        $1;
}

   To be precise, one would say that the id_parser method accepts a
   reference to a function as an argument.

14. More on [111]Bioperl

   Perhaps this article has gotten you interested in learning a bit more
   about [112]Bioperl. Here are some other things you might want to look
   at:

    1. The [113]bptutorial gives a good overview of many different
       topics. Few topics are covered in detail but many of the most
       important modules and concepts are covered.
    2. The [114]HOWTOs. Each one covers a topic in some detail, but there
       are certainly some HOWTOs that are missing that we would like to
       see written. Would you like to become an expert and write one
       yourself?
    3. The [115]module documentation. Each module is documented, but the
       quality and quantity varies by module.
    4. [116]Bioperl scripts. You'll find them in the scripts/ directory
       and in the examples/ directory of the [117]Bioperl package. The
       former contains more carefully written and documented scripts that
       can be installed along with [118]Bioperl. You should feel free to
       contribute scripts to either of these directories. There's also a
       complete list of scripts, [119]bioscripts.pod.
    5. [120]User-contributed documentation. There's some very good
       material here.

15. Perl's Documentation System

   The documentation for Perl is available using a system known as POD,
   which stands for Plain Old Documentation. You can access this built-in
   documentation by using the "perldoc" command. To view information on
   how to use perldoc, type the following at the command line:
>perldoc perldoc

   Perldoc is a very useful and versatile tool, shown below are some more
   examples on how to use perldoc.

   Read about Perl's built-in print function:
>perldoc -f print

   Read about any module, including any of the [121]Bioperl modules:
>perldoc Bio::SeqIO

16. The Basics of Perl Objects

   Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a software engineering technique
   for modularizing code. The difference between object-oriented
   programming and procedural programming can be simply illustrated.

   A Simple Procedural Example Assume that we have a DNA sequence stored
   in the scalar variable $sequence. We'd like to generate the reverse
   complement of this sequence and store it in $reverse_complement. Shown
   below is the procedural Perl technique of using a function, or
   sub-routine, to operate on this scalar data:

use Bio::Perl;

$reverse_complement = revcom( $sequence );

   The hallmark of a procedural program is that data and functions to
   operate on that data are kept separate. In order to generate the
   reverse complement of a DNA sequence, we need to call a function that
   operates on that DNA sequence.

   A Simple Object-Oriented Example Shown below is the object-oriented
   way of generating the reverse complement of a DNA sequence:

$reversed_obj = $seq_obj->revcom;

   The main difference between this object-oriented example and the
   procedural example shown before is that the method for generating the
   reverse complement, revcom, is part of $seq_obj. To put it another
   way, the object $seq_obj knows how to calculate and return its reverse
   complement. Encapsaluting both data and functions into the same
   construct is the fundamental idea behind object-oriented programming.

   Terminology In the object-oriented example above, $seq_obj is called
   an object, and revcom is called a method. An object is a data
   structure that has both data and methods associated with it. Objects
   are separated into types called classes, and the class of an object
   defines both the data that it can hold and the methods that it knows.
   A specific object that has a defined class is referred to as an
   instance of that class. In perl you could say that each module is
   actually a class, but for some reason the author of Perl elected to
   use the term "module" rather than "class".

   That's the sort of explanation you'll get in programming books, but
   what is a Perl object really? Usually a hash. In [122]Bioperl the data
   that the object contains is stored in a single, complex hash and the
   object, like $seq_obj, is a reference to this hash. In addition, the
   methods that the object can use are also stored in this hash as
   particular kinds of references. You could say that an object in
   [123]Bioperl is a special kind of hash reference.

   [124]Bioperl uses the object-oriented paradigm, and here are some
   texts if you want to learn more:

    1. [125]Object Oriented Perl
    2. The [126]Bioperl design documentation, for anyone who'd like to
       write their own modules.

These HOWTOs are written in DocBook XML.  See the LDP at
http://www.tldp.org for more information on how to write documents in
DocBook, in particular the LDP Author guide. DocBook XML can be
turned into PDF, HTML, text, and RTF (which can be turned into
MS Word).

As of this writing one cannot turn Docbook XML into these formats
using one single open source package. The PDF, HTML, and text versions
of the XML were created using saxon-j, Apache FOP, and lynx,
respectively. In addition, the XSL stylesheets from the e-novative 
eDe package were used, with these stylesheets one can create some
attractive documents. Examine the enclosed docbook-tx.sh script for 
details. All of the necessary stylesheets and associated files have 
been added to the Bioperl package.

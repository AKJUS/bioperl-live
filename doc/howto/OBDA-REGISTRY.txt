The BioDirectory Registry is a system for specifying how BioPerl
programs find sequence databases.  It uses a site-wide configuration
file, known as the registry, which defines one or more databases and
the access methods to use to access them.  

For instance, you might start out by accessing sequence data over the
web, and later decide to install a locally mirrored copy of GenBank.
By changing one line in the registry file, all BioPerl applications
will start using the mirrored local copy automatically - no source
code changes are necessary.

INSTALLING THE REGISTRY FILE

The registry file should be named seqdatabase.ini.  It should be
installed in one of the following locations:

   $HOME/.bioinformatics/seqdatabase.ini
   /etc/bioinformatics/seqdatabase.ini

If a local registry file cannot be found, BioPerl will take its
defaults from this URL:

   http://www.open-bio.org/registry/seqdatabase.ini

You may add a web-based registry file of your own by manipulating the
Bio::DB::Registry module.

FORMAT OF THE REGISTRY FILE

  The file is a simple stanza format which goes

  [database-name]
  tag=value
  tag=value

  [database-name]
  tag=value
  tag=value

where each stanza starts with the declaration of the database being in square 
brackets and following that one line tag=value tag value formats.

Database-name stanzas can be repeated, in which case the client should
try each service in turn (starting at the first one).

The options under each stanza must have two non-optional tag=value lines being

  protocol=<protocol-type>
  location=<location-string>

The Protocol Tag
----------------

The protocol tag species what access mode to use.  Currently it can be
one of:

  flat-bdb
  flat-binsearch
  biofetch
  bsane-corba
  biosql
  xembl

"flat-bdb" is used to fetch sequences from local flat files that have
been indexed using BerkeleyDB.  It corresponds to the
Bio::DB::Flat::BDB module.

"flat-binsearch" is used to fetch sequences from local flat files that
have been indexed using a binary search scheme.  It corresponds to the
Bio::DB::Flat::BinarySearch module.

"biofetch" is used to fetch sequences from web-based databses.  Due to
restrictions on the use of these databases, this is recommended only
for lightweight applications.

"bsane-corba" is used to fetch sequences from BSANE/CORBA services.
To use this service you will need to download the bioperl-corba
distribution.

"biosql" fetches sequences from BioSQL databases.  To use this module
you will need to install the bioperl-db distribution.

"xembl" uses the EBI's XEMBL web service to fetch sequences.  It
corresponds to Bio::DB::XEMBL;

The Location Tag
----------------

The location tag tells the bioperl sequence fetching code where the
database is located.  Its interpretation depends on the protocol
chosen.  For example, it might be a directory on the local file
system, or a remote URL.

Other Tags
----------

Any number of additional tag values are allowed.  The number and
nature of these tags depends on the access protocol selected.  Some
protocols require no additional tags, whereas others will require
several.

 Protocol       Tag       Description
 --------       ---       -----------

 flat-bdb       location  Directory in which the index is stored.
                          The "config.dat" file generated during
                          indexing must be found in this location.

 flat-binsearch location   Directory in which the index is stored.
                           The "config.dat" file generated during 
			   indexing must be found in this location.

 biofetch       location   Base URL for the web service.  Currently
                           the only compatible biofetch service is 
			   http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dbfetch

                biodbname  Name of the database.  Currently recognized
                           values are "embl" (sequence and protein),
                           "swall" (SwissProt + TREMBL), and "refseq"
                           (NCBI RefSeq entries).

 bsane-corba    location   <I don't know>
                <others?>

 biosql		location   <I don't know>
                <others?>

 xembl          location   The SOAP endpoint.  Currently the only
                           known compatible service is 
			   http://www.ebi.ac.uk:80/cgi-bin/xembl/XEMBL-SOAP.pl



>>>> NOTES TO MYSELF <<<<
Database Formats:

urn:lsid:open-bio.org:dbformat:<format>/<alphabet>

where <format> is one of:
      embl
      genbank
      fasta
      swis
      pdb

and <format> is one of:
    dna
    protein

For purposes of backward compatibility, can abbreviate to "embl/dna"
or just "embl".

>This HOWTO describes how to render sequence data graphically in a
horizontal map.  It applies to a variety of situations ranging from
rendering the feature table of a GenBank entry, to graphing the
positions and scores of a BLAST search, to rendering a clone map.  It
describes the programmatic interface to the Bio::Graphics module, and
discusses how to create dynamic web pages using Bio::DB::GFF and the
gbrowse package.</P

>This HOWTO describes the Bio::Graphics module, and some of the
applications that were built on top of it.  Bio::Graphics was designed
to solve the following common problems:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>You have a list of BLAST hits on a sequence and you want to
generate a picture that shows where the hits go and what their score
is.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>You have a big GenBank file with a complex feature table, and
you want to render the positions of the genes, repeats, promoters 
and other features.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>You have a list of ESTs that you've mapped to a genome, and you want
to show how they align.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>You have created a clone fingerprint map, and you want to display it.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>The Bio::Graphics module was designed to solve these problems.  In
addition, using the Bio::DB::GFF module (part of BioPerl) and the
gbrowse program (available from http://www.gmod.org) you can create
interactive web pages to explore your data.</P

Bio::Graphics in a cookbook fashion.</P

>Bio::Graphics is dependent on GD, a Perl module for generating
bitmapped graphics written by the author.  GD in turn is dependent on
libgd, a C library written by Thomas Boutell, formerly also of Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory.  To use Bio::Graphics, you must have both
these software libraries installed.</P
><P
>If you are on a Linux system, you might already have GD installed.  To
verify, run the following command:</P
><P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
> % perl -MGD -e 'print $GD::VERSION';</PRE
></P
><P
>If the program prints out a version number, you are in luck.
Otherwise, if you get a "Can't locate GD.pm" error, you'll have to
install the module.  For users of ActiveState Perl this is very easy.
Just start up the PPM program and issue the command "install GD".  For
users of other versions of Perl, you should go to www.cpan.org,
download a recent version of the GD module, unpack it, and follow the
installation directions.  You may also need to upgrade to a recent
version of the libgd C library.</P

><P
>You may need to upgrade to a recent version of the libgd C library.
At the time this was written, there were two versions of libgd.  libgd
version 1.8.4 is the stable version, and corresponds to GD version
1.43.  libgd version 2.0.1 is the beta version; although it has many
cool features, it also has a few known bugs (which Bio::Graphics works
around).  If you use libgd 2.0.1 or higher, be sure to use GD version
2.0.1 or higher.</P

>Our first example will be rendering a table of BLAST hits on a
sequence that is exactly 1000 residues long. For now, we're ignoring
finicky little details like HSPs, and assume that each hit is a single
span from start to end.  Also, we'll be using the BLAST score rather
than P or E value.  Later on, we'll switch to using real BLAST output
parsed by the Bio::SearchIO module, but for now, our table looks like
this:</P

>The script begins by loading the Bio::Graphics module (line 3), which
in turn brings in a number of other modules that we'll use later. We
then create a Bio::Graphics::Panel object by calling its new() method,
specifying that the panel is to correspond to a sequence that is 1000
residues long, and has a physical width of 800 bp (line 4).  The Panel
can contain multiple horizontal tracks, each of which has its own way
of rendering features (called a "glyph"), color, labeling convention,
and so forth.  In this simple example, we create a single track by
calling the panel object's add_track() method (line 5), specify
a glyph type of "generic", and ask that the objects in the track be
labeled by providing a true value to the -label argument.  This gives
us a track object that we can add our hits to.</P
><P
>We're now ready to render the blast hit file.  We loop through it
(line 6-13), stripping off the comments, and parsing out the name,
score and range (line 9).  We now need a Bio::SeqI object to place in
the track.  The easiest way to do this is to create a
Bio::Graphics::Feature object, which is similar to Bio::PrimarySeq,
except that it provides a way of attaching start and end positions to
the sequence, as well as such nebulous but useful attributes as the
"score" and "method".  The Bio::Graphics::Feature-&#62;new() method,
invoked in line 10, takes arguments corresponding to the name of each
hit, its start and end coordinates, and its score.</P
><P
>After creating the feature object, we add it to the track by calling
the track's add_feature() method (line 12).</P
><P
>After processing all the hits, we call the panel's png() method to
render them and convert it into a Portable Network Graphics file, the
contents of which are printed to standard output.  We can now view the
result by piping it to our favorite image display program.</P

>There are several changes to look at.  The first is minor.  We'd
like to put a boundary around the left and right edges of the image so
that the features don't bump up against the margin, so we specify a 10
pixel leeway with the -pad_left and -pad_right arguments in line 5.</P
><P
>The next change is more subtle.  We want to draw a scale all the way
across the image.  To do this, we create a track to contain the scale,
and a feature that spans the track from the start to the end.  Line 10
creates the feature, giving its start and end coordinates.  Lines
11-16 create a new track containing this feature.  Unlike the previous
example, in which we created the track first and then added features
one at a time with add_feature(), we show here how to add feature(s)
directly in the call to add_track().  If the first argument to
add_track is either a single feature or a feature array ref, then
add_track() will automatically incorporate the feature(s) into the
track in a single efficient step.  The remainder of the arguments
configure the track as before.  The -glyph argument says to use the
"arrow" glyph.  The -tick argument indicates that the arrow should
contain tick marks, and that both major and minor ticks should be
shown (tick type of "2").  We set the foreground color to black, and
request that arrows should be placed at both ends (-double =&#62;1).

>In lines 17-21, we get a bit fancier with the blast hit track.  Now,
instead of creating a generic glyph, we use the "graded_segments"
glyph.  This glyph takes the specified background color for the
feature, and either darkens or lightens it according to its score.  We
specify the base background color (-bgcolor =&#62; 'blue'), and the
minimum and maximum scores to scale to (-min_score and -max_score).
(You may need to experiment with the min and max scores in order to get
the glyph to scale the colors the way you want.)  The remainder of the
program is the same.</P

      <para>
		  This is a HOWTO written in DocBook (SGML) that talks about using
		  Bioperl, for biologists who would like to learn more
		  about writing their own bioinformatics scripts using Bioperl.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
		If you're a molecular biologist of some sort it's likely that
		you're interested in gene and protein sequences, and you study them
		in some way on a regular basis. Perhaps you'd like to try your
		hand at automating some of these tasks, or you're just curious
		about learning more about the programming side of bioinformatics.
		In this HOWTO you'll see discussion of some of the common tasks, 
		like sequence analysis with BLAST, retrieving sequences from 
		public databases, and making alignments. You'll also see how to
		write Bioperl scripts that chain these tasks together, that's
		how you're able to do really powerful things with Bioperl.
    </para>
    <para>
		You will also see some discussions of software concepts, it
		can't be avoided, and the more you understand about
		programming the better. All efforts will be made
		not to introduce too much unfamiliar material but 
		there is an introducton to modularity, or objects. This is 
		one of the aspects of the Bioperl package that you'll have
		to come to grips with as you attempt more complex tasks with
		your scripts.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
		  This HOWTO does not discuss a very nice module that's designed for
		  beginners, 
		  <ulink url="http://doc.bioperl.org/releases/bioperl-1.4/Bio/Perl">Bio::Perl</ulink>. The reason is that though this is an
			 excellent introductory tool, it can't be extended. What's
		  attempted here is both to introduce Bioperl and suggest
		  ways to expand your new-found skills.

		</programlisting>
	 </para>
	 <para>
		Hopefully you're using Perl version 5.4 or higher, earlier
		versions may be troublesome. Now let's find out where the Perl 
		program is located:
	 </para>	
	 <para>
		<programlisting>
			 >which perl
		</programlisting>
	 </para>
	 This will give you something like:
	 <para>
		<programlisting>
		  >/bin/perl
		</programlisting>
	 </para>
	 <para>
		Now that we know where Perl is located we're ready to write a
		script, and line 1 of the script will specify this location.
		You're probably using some Unix word processor, emacs or vi,
		for example  (nano or pico are other possible choices,
		very easy to use, but not found on all Unix machines unfortunately).
		Start to write your script by entering something like:
	 </para>
	 <para>
		<programlisting>
		  >emacs seqio.pl
		</programlisting>
	 </para>
	 <para>
	 And make this the first line:
	 </para>
	 <para>
		<programlisting>
		  #!/bin/perl -w
		</programlisting>
	 </para>
	 <para>
		The "-w" flag tells Perl to warn you if various common errors
		are encountered.
	 </para>
  </section>

  <section id="create">
	 <title>Creating a sequence, and an object</title>
    <para>
		Our first script will create a sequence. In the process of
		creating a sequence you will also be creating an "object", since
		Bioperl is written in an object-oriented way. Why be
		object-oriented? Why introduce these novel or intrusive notions into
		software that should be "biological" or "intuitive"? The reason is 
		that thinking in terms of modules or objects turns out to be the
		most flexible, and ultimately the simplest, way to deal with
		data as complex as biological data. Once you get over your initial
		skepticism, and have written a few scripts, you will find this
		idea of an object becoming a bit more natural.
	 </para>
	 <para>
		One way to think about an object in software is that it is a container
		for data. The typical sequence entry contains
		differents sorts of data as well, so it will serve as a nice example of what
		an object can be. All objects in Bioperl are associated with specific
		Bioperl modules, so if you want to create an object you're also going
		to have to tell Perl which module to use. Let's add another line:
    </para>	
    <para>
		<programlisting>
		  #!/bin/perl -w

		  use Bio::Seq;
		</programlisting>
    </para>
	 <para>
		We will "use" the Bio::Seq module in order to create a Bio::Seq object.
		The Bio::Seq module is one of the central modules in
		Bioperl. The analogous Bio::Seq object, or "sequence object", or
		"Seq object", is ubiquitous in Bioperl, it contains 
		a single sequence and associated names, identifiers, and
		properties. Let's create a very simple sequence object at
		first, like so:
    </para>
    <para>
		<programlisting>
		  #!/bin/perl -w

		  use Bio::Seq;
		
		  $seq_obj = Bio::Seq->new(-seq => "aaaatgggggggggggccccgtt");
		</programlisting>
    </para>
		<para>
		  When you assign a value to an object it's said that you that 
		  you have <emphasis>set</emphasis> a value. When you ask an object for
		  a value it's said that you <emphasis>get</emphasis> a value.
		</para>
	 <para>
      <note>
		  <para>
			 Bio::Seq objects can be created manually, as above, but
			 they're also create automatically in many operations
			 in Bioperl, for example when alignment files or
			 BLAST reports are parsed.
		  </para>
      </note>
	 </para>
	 <para>
		An object, like our $seq_obj above, is a specialized kind of a variable.
		Any time you explicitly create or intitialize the variable, you
		will use this <function>new()</function> method. The syntax of this
		line is one you'll see again and again in Bioperl: the name
		of the object or variable, the module name, the
		string <emphasis>new</emphasis>, some argument name like
		<emphasis>-seq</emphasis>, the <emphasis>=></emphasis>, and then
		the argument or value itself, like
		<emphasis>aaaatgggggggggggccccgtt</emphasis>.
	 </para>
	 <para>
		<note>
		  <para>
			 If you've programmed before you've probably come across the term
			 "function". In object-oriented programming the term
			 "method" is used instead.			 
		  </para>
		</note>
	 </para>
	 <para>
		The object was described as a data container, but it is more
		than that. It is also a variable that can access specific 
		methods, methods taken from the module or modules that were used
		to create it. For example, the <classname>Bio::Seq</classname> 
		module has a method
		called <function>seq()</function> that will print out the
		sequence of Bio::Seq objects. You could use it like this:
	 </para>
	 <para>
		<programlisting>
		  #!/bin/perl -w

		  use Bio::Seq;
		
		  $seq_obj = Bio::Seq->new(-seq => "aaaatgggggggggggccccgtt");

		  print $seq_obj->seq();
		</programlisting>
	 </para>
	 <para>
		As you'd expect, this script will print out <emphasis>
		  aaaatgggggggggggccccgtt</emphasis>. That <emphasis>->
		</emphasis> symbol is used when an object calls or accesses
		its methods. When you obtain a value from an object it's said 
		that you that you <emphasis>get</emphasis> that value.
	 </para>
	 <para>
		Let's make our example a bit more true-to-life, since a typical
		sequence needs a name, perhaps an identifier, in addition to
		its sequence.
	 </para>
	 <para>
		<programlisting>
		  #!/bin/perl -w

		  use Bio::Seq;
		
		  $seq_obj = Bio::Seq->new(-seq => "aaaatgggggggggggccccgtt",
		                           -id => "#12345"
		                           -display_name => "example 1" );

		  print $seq_obj->seq();
		</programlisting>
	 </para>
  </section>

  <section id="writing">
    <title>Writing a sequence to a file</title>
	 <para>
		This next example will show how two objects can work together
		to create a sequence file.
		We already have a sequence object, and we will create an
		additional object whose responsibility it is to read from and write
		to files. This object is the <classname>Bio::SeqIO</classname> object, 
		where IO stands for <emphasis>I</emphasis>nput-<emphasis>O</emphasis>utput.
		By using Bio::SeqIO in this manner you will be able to get input
		and output from all of the sequence file formats supported by Bioperl
		(the <ulink url="http://bioperl.org/HOWTOs/SeqIO/index.html">
		  SeqIO HOWTO</ulink> has a complete list of supported formats).
		The way you create <classname>Bio::SeqIO</classname> objects is 
		very similar to the way we used <function>new()</function> to
		create a <classname>Bio::Seq</classname>, or sequence, object:
	 </para>    
	 <para>
		<programlisting>
		  use Bio::SeqIO;

		  my $seq_io = Bio::SeqIO->new(-file => '>sequence.fasta', 
		                               -format => 'fasta' );
		</programlisting> 
	 </para> 
	 <para>
	   Note that <emphasis>&gt;</emphasis> character in the -file argument.
	       This indicates that we're going to
	       <emphasis>write</emphasis> to the file named
	       "sequence.fasta", the same character we'd use if we were using Perl's
	       <function>open()</function> function to write to a file.
    </para>
    <para/>
  </section>

  <section id="retrieving_gb">
	 <title>Retrieving a sequence from a file</title>
	 <para>
		A common beginner's mistake is to not use
		<classname>Bio::SeqIO</classname> when working with sequence
		files. This is understandable in some respects, you
		may have read about Perl's <function>open</function>
		function, and Bioperl's way of retrieving sequences may look odd
		and overly complicated, at first. But don't use
		<function>open()</function>! Using <function>open</function> 
		immediately forces you to do the parsing of the sequence
		file and this can get complicated very quickly. Trust
		SeqIO, it's built to open and parse all
		the common sequence formats, it can read and write to files,
		and it's built to operate with all the other Bioperl 
		modules that you will want to use.

			 <emphasis>A Simple Example</emphasis>
			 Assume that we have a DNA sequence stored in the scalar variable

		</para>
		  
		  <para>
			 The hallmark of a procedural program is that data and functions to
			 operate on that data are kept separate. In order to generate the reverse
			 complement of a DNA sequence, we need to call a function that operates
			 on that DNA sequence.

		  <para>
			 The main difference between this object-oriented example and the
			 procedural example shown before is that the function for
			 generating the reverse complement (called "revcom") part of
			 $sequence. To put it another way, $sequence knows how to calculate
			 and return its reverse complement. Encapsaluting both data and
			 functions into the same construct is the fundamental idea behind
			 object-oriented programming.

		  <para>
			 <emphasis>Terminology</emphasis>
			 In the object-oriented example above, $sequence is called an
			 object, and the function "revcom" is called a method. An object
			 is a data structure that has both data and methods associated
			 with it. Objects are separated into types called classes, and the
			 class of an object defines both the data that it can hold and the 
			 methods that it knows.

            Let's dissect this example line-by-line. Line one defines the path to
            the Perl interpreter (/usr/bin/perl), which is called when the program
            is executed. While not absolutely necessary (especially on a Windows
            machine), it's a good practice to this line to ensure that programs
            will run on a Unix machine. This line is sometimes referred to as the
            "shebang". Line three tells the Perl interpreter to be strict when
            running this program, and to print informative diagnostic messages
            when it encounters a potential error. While not absolutely necessary,
            lines 1-3 are included at the beginning of most Perl programs.
         </para>

         <para>
            Line 4 tells the Perl interpreter to "use the Bio::SeqIO module." While
            this is an over-simplified explanation of what's actually happening,
            it will suffice for now. Lines 6-7 will require a lot of explanation:
            <simplelist type="horiz" columns="1">
               <member>
                  The new method of the Bio::SeqIO module is called. This method
                  is used to construct and return a new Bio::SeqIO object.
               </member>
               <member>
                  This method is passed two arguments: a file value "seq.fasta" and
                  a format value of "fasta". These arguments tell Bio::SeqIO that
                  $seqio will read sequence information from a file named seq.fasta
                  that is stored in the FASTA sequence file format.
               </member>
               <member>
                  The object returned by the "new" method is assigned to the scalar
                  variable $seqio. 
               </member>
               <member>
                  The word "my" tells the Perl interpreter that this is the
                  first time that the variable $seqio has been used, and it
                  also defines the scope of $seqio. Writing "my" before the
                  first use of a variable is a requirement when "using strict."
               </member>
            </simplelist>
               
            The "new" method called in line 6 is called the <emphasis>constructor</emphasis>
            of Bio::SeqIO, as it is used to construct Bio::SeqIO objects.
         </para>

         <para>
            After executing line 7 of the program listed above, Perl has created a Bio::SeqIO
            object named $seqio that will read from a FASTA-formatted file named seq.fasta.
            At this point, the program isn't very impressive, but adding more functionality 
            is not very difficult.

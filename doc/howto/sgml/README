These HOWTOs are written in DocBook SGML.  See the LDP at
http://www.tldp.org for more information on how to write documents in
DocBook, in particular the LDP Author guide. DocBook SGML can be
turned into PDF, HTML, Text, and RTF (which can be turned into
MSWord).

To process the SGML files I reccomend docbook2pdf, docbook2html, docbook2txt which are part of the docbook-utils package.  There are fink packages for this on OS X and RPMs on linux.

For the XML I find that saxon + fop work fine on OSX using the fink
packages for these.  Some helpful pages here talk about the XSLT
process for rendering the docbook XML.
http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/doc/publishing.html

I do it like this
saxon FILE.xml my.xsl > FILE.fo
 OR
xsltproc FILE.xml my.xsl > FILE.fo

Where my.xsl is something like /usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets/fo/docbook.xsl or /sw/share/xml/xsl/docbook-xsl/fo/

fop FILE.fo FILE.pdf

=head1 NAME

Bio::SeqIO::swissprot - Swissprot sequence input/output stream

=head1 SYNOPSIS

It is probably best not to use this object directly, but
rather go through the SeqIO handler system. Go:

    $stream = Bio::SeqIO->new(-file => $filename, -format => 'swissprot');

    while ( my $seq = $stream->next_seq() ) {
	# do something with $seq
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an alias for the "swiss" format, included here just for OBDA
naming compatibility.

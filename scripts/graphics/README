These are scripts that run on top of Bio::Graphics

render_sequence.pl	fetch a GenBank or EMBL entry off the net (fetching by accession number)
	    		and render into a graphical picture

feature_draw.pl		render a set of features into a drawing, using Bio::Graphics::FeatureFile's
			idiosyncratic (but relatively friendly)
			feature notation.

frend			the same thing, but a CGI front end

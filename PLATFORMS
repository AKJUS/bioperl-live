Perl general comments:

Perl 5.000404 and lower often have problems with GDB.t

Perl on Digital Unix has been reported to have problems
with GDB.t. This maybe something to do with the LWP version

DB.t has intermittent time-out failures

Index.t will fail if you have an out-of-date DBM file
installation

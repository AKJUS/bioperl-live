Perl general comments:

	o Perl 5.00404 and lower often have problems with GDB.t

	o Perl on Digital Unix has been reported to have problems
	with GDB.t. This maybe something to do with the LWP version

	o DB.t has intermittent time-out failures (which will
	most likely cause tests 3 and/or 27 to fail)

	o Index.t will fail if you have an out-of-date DBM file
	installation
